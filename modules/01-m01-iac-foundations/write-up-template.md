# m01 Write-Up: IaC Foundations

> **Instructions for the trainee:**
> Copy this file to `write-up.md` in this folder and fill it in as the work goes, not at the end. A write-up finished after the build already works tends to be thin, and it is both the checkpoint evidence and the draft teaching content for the next cohort. Write it so a trainee starting this stage next cohort could follow the same path. Delete all blockquotes (like this one) before submitting. **Never paste credentials, tokens, or key material.**

## 1. Deliverable & Evidence
> Link the code and provide the exact output proving it works, based on the Definition of Done (DoD) IDs from the brief. Paste real output, trimmed to the relevant lines and redacted, or link a screenshot.

**Repository:** [Link here]
**Overview:** [One or two sentences, in the trainee's own words, on what was built in this stage]
**Deliverable:** the `intro/` Terraform project (`main.tf`) with its README of commands used and expected result

*   **DoD-m01.8:** The plan output and a directory listing taken straight after it, showing `hello.txt` does not exist yet
    *   *Output/Evidence:*
*   **DoD-m01.9:** The plan output for the content change, showing it as an in-place update
    *   *Output/Evidence:*
*   **DoD-m01.7:** The apply and destroy output, with a directory listing after each showing the file present, then gone
    *   *Output/Evidence:*

## 2. How to build it (teach it to the next trainee)
> Write a guide covering the scope below, in the order the work was tackled and with the reason for that order. Use the trainee's own output and logs to show reasoning, not just a list of commands. Assume the reader is a peer who has not started this stage yet.

**Guide scope:** from an empty folder to a local project that runs the full init, plan, apply, update and destroy cycle with no cloud account

## 3. Decisions & Core Concepts
> This section covers the *why* behind the build and the theory applied.

**Key Decisions**
> Design choices and trade-offs, including any alternative that was considered and rejected.

*   **What did the trainee check in each plan before approving an apply or destroy, and how did the plan show that nothing had been created yet?**
*   **Where do the configuration, the recorded state and the real file each live, and which of them does a plan compare?**

**Concepts Applied**
> Pick 2 to 3 of the ideas below. Explain each in the trainee's own words, based on how it was actually used in this stage, as if teaching someone who has never seen it.

**Ideas this stage covers:** HCL block structure, Infrastructure as Code, providers, resources, or modules and the root module.

## 4. AI Collaboration Log
> Be specific, and answer each prompt below in as many lines as it needs. Only if no AI was used at all, say so in one line and skip the rest.

*   **Tools & Scope:** Which AI tool(s) were used, and for roughly what portion of the work?
*   **Prompt Examples:** Give 2 to 3 concrete examples of what the trainee asked for.
*   **Course Correction:** Describe at least one moment the tool's first suggestion was wrong, inefficient, or did not fit the design. What was wrong, how was it noticed, and what was done instead?
*   **Human Intervention:** What was accepted largely as-is, and what did the trainee rewrite or redesign personally?

## 5. Retrospective & Self-Assessment
> Reflect on the friction faced, how the work grades against the DoD, and what would change.

*   **Friction Log (What tripped the trainee up):** Where was the most time spent, and why? What did not behave as expected the first time? Keep the exact error texts, the cause, and how each was resolved, including dead ends and how the trainee got unstuck.
*   **What I'd do differently:** If the trainee started this stage over today, what is the single biggest change to the approach?
*   **DoD Self-Assessment:** Rate the work honestly against every DoD ID in the stage (Met, Partly Met, Not Met) and against the stage rubric.
*   **Blind Spots:** Name any part of the work the trainee would struggle to explain cold right now, without re-reading it first.
